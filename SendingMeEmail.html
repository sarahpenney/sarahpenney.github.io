            <p>Making sure your Email looks good for all your recipients is top of my priority.
                I take time to make sure the Email looks great across tricky clients like Outlook
                And Gmail and understand what works and does not, so we can work together to get the best possible outcome.</p>
                
                <p>Taking the example of a simple Email I designed and built for a Mindfulness Coach, you can see 
                the logo is not lost in the dark background, and all copy is readable and at good colour contrast levels.</p>
                
                <p>The hero image is something that is sometimes missed out when thinking about Darkmode and 
                Accessibility across clients. Here we have made sure for most clients the background image changes to a dark version, with the copy
                changing to light In Darkmode, and for clients where its not possible to change the image, like Gmail, we have made sure there is
                a colour strip on top of the image, so the copy does not get lost in the light mode background image. *see phone image below</p>
